About the query fuzz test

The file jsinq-query-fuzz.html performs a really simple fuzz test, by feeding
random well-formed queries into the jsinq.Query constructor. The fuzz test
will then report any errors that may occur during the subsequent query
compilation. These errors include those produced by the compiler itself but
also errors the JavaScript runtime may report upon evaluating the code 
generated by the compiler (these include syntactical- but not semantical 
errors). The fuzz test has proven itself useful by unveiling a particular type
of query that would cause the compiler to enter an infinite loop. It also 
helped in finding another bug in the compiler, where only parts of a query
expression would be translated into JavaScript code.
